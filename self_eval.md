# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?

I was proud of my ability to collaborate with my peers!

- What is the power of using methods in our applications?

It allows to you execute a piece of code many times, instead of writing a piece of code again and again, you can use a method
to more easily interact with it.
